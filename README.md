# The Bobbing Channel (Bobby TV)

A 24/7 streaming television channel broadcasting vintage Archive.org content to stream.place, complete with satirical news tickers and professional overlays.

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Launch the control center
./bobby_tv.sh

# Select option 1 to start streaming
```

That's it! The system handles everything else automatically.

## üì∫ What Is This?

The Bobbing Channel is a fully automated TV station that:
- Streams 24/7 to stream.place (AT Protocol streaming platform)
- Broadcasts curated content from Archive.org's public domain collection
- Features satirical news tickers with Onion-style headlines
- Runs efficiently on minimal hardware (Raspberry Pi compatible)
- Manages storage intelligently (only keeps 2 videos at a time)

## üéØ The Vision

> "I made a television channel for stream.place using my media collection that is unique and interesting."

This project realizes that vision with:
- **1,327+ curated titles** from https://archive.org/details/@mark_pines_archive_project
- **Smart rotation** - downloads and deletes content automatically
- **Professional presentation** - overlays, tickers, channel branding
- **Zero maintenance** - runs forever once started

## üìÅ Project Components

### 1. `catalog_explorer/` - Content Browser
Web interface for browsing the media library
- Browse 1,327+ Archive.org items
- Search by type, year, popularity
- Visual grid layout
- Runs at http://localhost:5001

### 2. `shitting_it_out/` - Broadcasting Engine
The core streaming system
- **OBS Feeder**: Seamlessly swaps videos with zero interruption
- **Video Manager**: Downloads and rotates content (2 videos max)
- **Overlay Generator**: Creates HTML overlays with news ticker
- **Stream Coordinator**: Manages the whole operation

### 3. `b_roll/` - Content Database
SQLite database of curated Archive.org content
- 1,327 items with metadata
- Curated from @mark_pines_archive_project

## üèó Architecture

```
[Archive.org] ‚Üí [Video Manager] ‚Üí [Local Storage] ‚Üí [OBS Feeder] ‚Üí [OBS] ‚Üí [stream.place]
                                    (2 videos)           ‚Üì
                                                   [HTML Overlay]
                                                   (News Ticker)
```

### Key Innovation: The OBS Feeder

Traditional streaming requires complex playlist management. Our solution:
1. OBS reads ONE file: `current_stream.mp4`
2. The feeder atomically swaps this file with new content
3. OBS never knows the file changed - seamless playback!

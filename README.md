# The Bobbing Channel

I made a television channel for stream.place using my media collection that is unique and interesting.

I take the media...I stream it to stream.place

Thats it thats the bit.

I will add overlays, weird interludes, I dont know what else

the media is found here

I think we start by making it so we download ~24hrs of video a day and decide what to show at random making "shows" and having me select programming

I should be able to run the contents of this channel and its lineup from a mobile website or something on my phone

since its anchored to the media at the base we want to be able to just swap things in and have default programming i control

it should really end ujp being a live channel I feel like I own that is broadcast from my raspberry pi to stream.place saving video locally a few at a time and serving it out fromt he SD card rather than archive.org

what do you think we build here? what does it look like?

Ultimately it will be streamed on stream.place

and I should be able to control it from the web and view it from stream.place live served from the pi

lets get started?
